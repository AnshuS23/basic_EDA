What is EDA?
Exploratory data analysis (EDA), as the name says, is an approach to analyzing/exploring datasets to summarize a dataset's characteristics and interesting findings.
Often, these characteristics are summarized visually.

Main reasons we use EDA
To get a first look at the data.
To display the data so that the most interesting features will become apparent. We can then use these features for a machine learning objective.
For detection of mistakes
For checking assumptions
For a preliminary selection of appropriate models
For determining relationships among the input variables, and
For assessing the direction and rough size of relationships between input and target variables.

The dataset we will be using here is the Wine Quality data containing certain information about Red Wine.

Quality of the wine is based on sensory scores (median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts). Each expert graded the wine quality between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).

This popular dataset is commonly used for predicting whether a particular wine is “good quality” or not.
